title: "Get interface addresses in a scriptable format in Linux"
---

<h4>Preface</h4>
<p>I noticed it's annoyingly difficult to get the IP addresses assigned to your network interfaces for scripting purposes.</p>
<p>I ended up writing the fairly simple one-liner below that lists all IPv4 addresses (change -4 to -6 for IPv6) in the format "interface-address", e.g. "eth0-192.168.1.1".</p>
<p>It also ignores the loopback address since that's generally quite irrelevant.</p>
<p>I personally used this to check which interfaces a certain program was communicating over and send me alerts if it uses the wrong interface.</p>

<h4>Code</h4>
{% highlight bash linenos %}
ip -o -4 addr show | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk '{print $2"-"$4}' | cut -d'/' -f1
{% endhighlight %}

<p>You can then use this in your scripts for something like:</p>

{% highlight bash linenos %}
eth0ip=$(ip -o -4 addr show | grep -v '127.0.0.1' | awk '{print $2"-"$4}' | cut -d'/' -f1 | grep 'eth0-' | cut -d'-' -f2)
{% endhighlight %}
