<h2>How's the weather over there?</h2>

<p><strong>A lot of people</strong> talk about the weather for small talk. So for small talk's sake, here's how the weather is like where I live at the moment.</p>

<p>
	<img id="weather_channel" src="http://lietu.net/weather/latest.jpg" title="Current weather" />
</p>

<p>The image should be at most some 2 minutes old and should auto-update once a minute if you're lucky. If it doesn't, you either have a crappy browser, or my system is broke somehow. Either way, too bad.</p>

<h2>So you want your own weather channel?</h2>

<p>This feed has been generated with <a href="https://github.com/lietu/lweamonit" title="Lightweight weather monitor">lweamonit</a>, feel free to set up your own.</p>

<script type="text/javascript">
try {
	var weatherImage = document.getElementById('weather_channel');
	weatherSrc = weatherImage.src;
	setInterval(function() {
		// Seems to work just fine at least in chrome, if it doesn't in others, too bad.
		weatherImage.src = weatherSrc
	}, 60000)
} catch(e) {;}
</script>
