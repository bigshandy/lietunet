<h2>The home of Janne Enberg, aka. Lietu</h2>

<p><strong>Welcome to my homepage</strong>. Here I have collected some information about myself, who I am, and what I can do. These pages use <strong>JavaScript</strong> to deliver (hopefully) a slightly better user experience. I decided I will give free access to it under the GPLv3 license, in case anyone wants to use it, but mostly so you can see a few example lines of code I've written. Oh, and it requires <strong>jQuery</strong>. You can find the source code in my <a href="https://github.com/lietu/lietunet">GitHub project page</a></p>

<p><strong>The pages have</strong> been designed to work with modern browsers, e.g. recent versions of Firefox, <strong>Chrome</strong>, Safari and Internet Explorer. If you are using some other browser and the site doesn't look nice, too bad, get a real browser. If you are using a recent version of a modern browser and have issues, please let me know and I might fix it.</p>
